A young man once wrote in on our old site and asked about motivation.  He wanted to work out consistently, he said, but he just couldn't get motivated.  He asked about music, or inspiration.  

Our response was blunt, but honestly what he needed to hear.  I told him that we couldn't give him inspiration.  He needed goals.  And those goals needed to matter.  Without purpose, there is no motivation. 

Looking "jacked," "swole" or "ripped" is not meaningful.  Being healthy and strong is.  Being able to perform a specific job or mission, even more so.  So having bigger biceps will not be enough motivation to train.  Making it through selection, passing a police academy, or being strong and fit enough to rescue even the heaviest victim from a fire... those are meaningful.  Stop obsessing with your own appearance, and start focusing on living better and being more useful.  

This is not "pimp my ride," this is real life.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f162233f-1e90-40df-b74b-bd5a741bb1ad.jpg)
